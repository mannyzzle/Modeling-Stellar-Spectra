# Modeling-Stellar-Spectra

This repository contains Python code for a project on the analysis and modeling of stellar spectra using data from the APOGEE survey. The project uses machine learning techniques to predict stellar properties based on their spectra.

## Installation

Before running the scripts, ensure you have Python installed and then install the required packages & files :

allStar: https://live-sdss4org-dr16.pantheonsite.io/irspec/spectro_data/
sensitivity lines: https://github.com/jobovy/apogee/blob/main/apogee/spec/plot.py

## Refer to Modeling_Stellar_Spectra.pdf for a full report on the project
